// What is Reactive Programming?
// Reactive programming is programming with event streams

// Example 1
// Below is a program which console.log() the source array which is already in memory
const example1 = (() => {
  console.clear();
  const source = ['1', '2', '3'];
  const result = source;
  console.log(result);
})();
