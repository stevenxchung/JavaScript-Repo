## Lesson 1: Course Introduction

> Whether you've studied computer science before and need a refresher, or you're like me and never had the chance to study it in school, my hope is that this course is a great introduction to the concepts of data structures and algorithms.

> We'll cover queues, stacks, linked lists, graphs and trees, breadth first and depth first search, tree traversal, and a variety of sorting algorithms.

> The goal of this course isn't for you to be able to implement these from scratch, though that's precisely what we'll do. Instead, the goal is to teach you to think differently, to learn how to use the right tool for the job, to break problems down into their atomic, algorithmic steps, and even to think divergently, to conceive of several solutions to the same problem understand their tradeoffs. These skills will make you a better engineer for sure.
